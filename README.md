Shopping App
App Design
Our shopping App will be called “ElectroZon” electronics shopping app. 
We will be storing our product descriptions in a database. We are using a SQLite database server and will be storing several 
products with their descriptions based on product type, brand, price, and other product specification.
Activities
Currently our activities are mainly lists of products. 
We plan to implement product specific pages where product descriptions and images will be. 
As well as an add to cart button. Our shopping cart functionality is in its early stages as well. 
We don’t have images of UI elements to show of that at this time however.
Future developments
We currently working on our full product description layout. We want it to convey all the relevant product and technical 
information as well as an option to compare it with another product. We would like to add a search functionality as well. 
Perhaps from the main activity. Add a search box at the bottom and the user can jump to any products matching the string 
the input.
